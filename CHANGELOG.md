## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-06

### 🚀 Major Release: The "AI Nutrition Overhaul"

This release fundamentally upgrades how meals can be logged by leveraging on-device and cloud AI, drastically reducing the friction of tracking nutrition. It also adds personalized meal recommendations.

### ✨ Top Features
- **AI Meal Capture Screen**: You can now log complex meals automatically via a single photo, voice dictation, or a quick text description. 
- **AI Recommendations**: Receive personalized meal, snack, and drink recommendations directly within the app, specifically tailored to perfectly fill out your remaining daily macronutrients, while respecting your dietary preferences (Vegan, Quick, etc.).
- **Magical AI Interface**: Brand new, fully animated magical UI for AI features, providing visual feedback during analysis with an elegant gradient design.
- **Smart Ingredient Matching**: AI identifies local database items based on the language of your device, combining and portioning foods intuitively (like merging multiple eggs).
- **Privacy Controls**: Added an "AI Kill-Switch" in settings to globally disable all AI interfaces if preferred. API keys are encrypted at rest using native secure storage (`flutter_secure_storage`).

### 🧠 Logic & Database Overhaul
- **Re-ranked Fuzzy Search**: Implemented dart-side re-ranking to prioritize exact database matches, base foods over user creations, and handle compounding accurately. 
- **AI System Prompts**: Custom system prompts block nutritional hallucinations, enforcing the AI to strictly identify weights and component names.
- **No API Lock-in**: Select between OpenAI (GPT-4o) and Google Gemini (Flash) seamlessly depending on your preferred API key.

### 🎨 UI/UX Refinements
- **Glass Bottom Menus**: Introduced consistent glassmorphism to bottom sheets across the entire app for value editing.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Removed heavy neon backgrounds in favor of targeted gradient accents on UI entry points, maintaining a clean and beautiful design language.


## [0.6.0-alpha.3] - 2026-03-05

### ✨ New Feature: AI Kill-Switch (#85)

- **Global toggle**: Added "Enable AI Features" switch in Settings → AI Meal Capture. Defaults to enabled; persisted via SharedPreferences.
- **Conditional UI**: When disabled, all AI entry points disappear without layout gaps:
  - Speed Dial: "AI Meal" action removed from the action list.
  - Nutrition Explorer: Gradient AI button next to barcode scanner hidden.
  - Settings: AI Settings navigation card conditionally shown only when AI is enabled.
- **Localization**: Added `aiEnableTitle` and `aiEnableSubtitle` strings in both English and German.

### 🎨 UI Improvements

- **AI Review Screen**: Replaced plain `AlertDialog` for quantity editing with the app's custom `showGlassBottomMenu` widget, ensuring visual consistency with the rest of the app (glass styling, keyboard-aware padding, visual style adaptation).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **AI Review Quantity Editor**: Fixed `_dependents.isEmpty` assertion crash when closing the quantity editor. Root cause was disposing a `TextEditingController` while the glass bottom menu's exit animation was still playing.

## [0.6.0-alpha.2] - 2026-03-05

### 🎨 UI Redesign: Minimalist AI Interface (#84)

- **Removed gradient overload**: Stripped animated aura background, glassmorphic segmented toggle, gradient mic button, and glassmorphic action buttons from the AI Meal Capture screen.
- **AI gradient now accents entry points only**: Speed-dial icon, Settings entry icon, and Nutrition Explorer search bar icon use a `ShaderMask` rainbow gradient.
- **Analyze button**: Remains the sole gradient CTA with a smooth, deterministic shimmer animation during loading. Text and spinner are rendered above the gradient background.
- **Inline loading**: Replaced the modal `_AnalyzingOverlay` popup with an in-button animated gradient + spinner.
- **Empty states**: Photo, Voice, and Text tabs now show a centered placeholder with a faded icon and helper text when no input is present.
- **Text field fix**: Replaced broken Container+InputBorder.none with proper `OutlineInputBorder` for clean border radius on the text input tab.
- **New entry point**: Added AI icon with gradient accent next to the barcode scanner in the Nutrition Explorer search bar.

### 🧠 AI Logic Improvements

- **Locale-aware prompts**: `AiService` now accepts `languageCode` — the system prompt explicitly instructs the AI to return food names in the user's app language (e.g., "Apfel" not "Apple" when language is "de").
- **Item consolidation**: System prompt rule prevents duplicate entries — "4 eggs" returns one "Egg" entry with combined weight (240g).
- **No nutritional hallucination**: AI is instructed to return only food names and estimated gram weights. Calorie/macro values are looked up from the local database.
- **Simple base names**: AI returns short, generic food names (e.g., "Banane" not "Reife Banane") to maximize database match rates.

### 🔍 Improved Fuzzy Matching

- **Dart-side re-ranking**: `fuzzyMatchForAi` now fetches 20 candidates from SQL, then re-ranks in Dart with priority: exact match → starts-with → shortest partial match.
- **Source priority preserved**: Base foods still rank above user and Open Food Facts entries within each match tier.
- **Accuracy**: Searching for "Apfel" now correctly returns "Apfel" instead of "Erdapfel" or compound dishes.

### 📦 Code Reduction

- `ai_meal_capture_screen.dart`: ~1264 → ~870 lines (−31%), removed 3 animation controllers, 5 glassmorphic widgets, and the modal overlay.

## [0.6.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-05

### 🚀 New Feature: AI Meal Capture (#81)

Capture meals faster using photos, voice, or text — powered by AI. Users provide their own API key (stored securely via `flutter_secure_storage`), and the app detects foods with estimated quantities, then lets users review and edit before saving.

### ✨ New Features

- **AI Meal Capture Screen**: New screen accessible from the diary FAB for logging meals via:
  - **Photo input**: Take a photo or pick from gallery (up to 4 images for multi-angle accuracy).
  - **Voice input**: Describe your meal by speaking — speech-to-text with on-device recognition.
  - **Text input**: Type a free-form meal description.
- **AI Meal Review Screen**: Review AI-detected foods before saving — edit quantities, swap items, add/remove entries.
- **AI Settings Screen**: Configure API provider (OpenAI GPT-4o or Google Gemini), enter API key, and test connectivity.
- **Multi-Provider AI Service**: Supports both OpenAI and Gemini APIs with dynamic payload formatting and structured JSON response parsing.
- **Complex Meal Handling**: AI system prompt forces decomposition of composite meals into individual ingredients (e.g., "Burger" → bun, patty, lettuce, cheese, sauce).

### 🎨 UI/UX: "Magical" AI Interface

- **Animated Aura Background**: 5 floating gradient orbs (pink, cyan, orange, purple, emerald) on independent coprime animation cycles (13s / 17s / 23s) — the combined pattern repeats only after ~85 minutes, creating truly organic, non-deterministic motion.
- **Glassmorphic Controls**: Custom frosted-glass segmented toggle for input modes with pastel rainbow gradient indicator.
- **Pastel Rainbow Buttons**: Analyze button and microphone button use a washed-out 5-color spectrum (pink → peach → gold → mint → cyan).
- **Enhanced Analyzing Overlay**: Rotating SweepGradient ring, hue-cycling sparkle icon, and animated gradient progress bar during AI processing.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Diary Bug (Critical)**: Fixed AI-detected foods not appearing in the diary. Root cause was mismatched meal type keys — the AI review screen used bare values (`'lunch'`) while the diary expected prefixed keys (`'mealtypeLunch'`).
- **Database Prioritization**: `fuzzyMatchForAi` now strictly orders results: base foods first (priority 0), then user foods (1), then Open Food Facts entries (2), followed by name length.

### 🔧 Permissions & Configuration

- **Android**: Added `RECORD_AUDIO` permission to `AndroidManifest.xml` for voice input.
- **iOS**: Fixed `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (previously stated "no mic access needed") and added missing `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`.
- **Speech Recognition**: Configured `speech_to_text` with dictation mode, 60s listen duration, 10s pause tolerance, partial results, locale auto-detection, and `cancelOnError: false`.

### 📦 Dependencies

- `speech_to_text: ^7.0.0`
- `flutter_secure_storage` (for API key storage)
- `image_picker` (for photo capture)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-04

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **RIR Field Validation (#83)**: Fixed the RIR (Reps in Reserve) field not correctly accepting and persisting values.
  - The field now defaults to empty/null instead of being hardcoded to 2.
  - Clearing the field correctly persists as null (previously reverted to the old value).
  - Target RIR values from routines now appear as placeholder hints in the Live Workout screen.
  - Non-numeric and negative input is now rejected via input validation.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### 🚀 Major Release: The "Foundation Overhaul"

This release represents a complete modernization of Hypertrack's core architecture. The database has been rebuilt from the ground up, the onboarding experience has been rewritten, and the app has been fully rebranded. After extensive alpha testing, v0.5.0 is the new stable baseline.

### ✨ New Features

- **Complete Onboarding Wizard**: Replaced the old single-page tutorial with a multi-step setup wizard covering Name/Birthday, Height/Gender, Weight, Calories, Macros, and Water goals — all with precise text input fields.
- **Cardio Exercise Support**: The app now fully supports cardio exercises.
  - Dynamic input fields switch from "Kg / Reps" to "Distance (km) / Time (min)" based on exercise category.
  - Cardio routines default to 1 set and summarize as "Total Distance | Total Duration".
- **RIR (Reps In Reserve) Tracking**: Plan and log training intensity with RIR fields in routines, live workouts, and workout history.
- **Session Restoration**: Active workouts now survive app restarts — all logged sets, exercise order, and in-progress values are automatically recovered.
- **Profile 2.0**: Redesigned Profile Screen displaying Age, Gender, and Height alongside the profile picture, with inline editing.
- **Auto-Caffeine Logging**: Caffeinated drinks automatically create corresponding Supplement Log entries.
- **App Initializer Screen**: Database updates now show a clear progress screen during startup instead of running silently in the background.
- **Portrait Lock**: The app orientation is now locked to portrait for a consistent experience.

### 💾 Database & Architecture

- **Schema v6 Migration**: Major database overhaul adding `height`, `gender`, `birthday` to Profiles, `carbsPer100ml` to FluidLogs, and `rir`/`pauseSeconds` columns for workout tracking.
- **Single Source of Truth**: User goals (Calories, Macros, Water) migrated from `SharedPreferences` to the SQLite database (`app_settings` table). Changing goals now updates the Dashboard instantly without restart.

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Edit Routine Overhaul**: Completely refactored to match the Live Workout design with `WorkoutCard`, `SetTypeChip`, and consistent column layout.
- **AppBar Consistency**: Fixed back button visibility in light mode across Live Workout and Scanner screens.

### Added
- **Cardio Support**: Introduced specialized tracking for cardio exercises.
  - **Dynamic Input Fields**: Based on exercise category ('Cardio'), the input fields in *Live Workout* and *Routine Editor* automatically switch from "Kg / Reps" to "**Distance (km) / Time (min)**".
  - **Routine Logic**: Cardio exercises in routines now default to 1 set (instead of 3) and initialize with empty fields.
  - **Summary & History**: Cardio results are now summarized as "Total Distance | Total Duration" instead of volume.
- **Detailed Database Initialization**:
  - Replaced background database updates with a dedicated **App Initializer Screen**.
  - This screen blocks the UI during startup, displaying a progress bar and detailed status ("Updating base foods: 1500/9000..."), preventing app lag and missing data issues.

### Fixed

    *   The standard "Glass" UI remains the default.

### Fixed
*   **Critical: Create Food Screen Unusable**
    *   Fixed a critical bug where the "Create Food" screen incorrectly displayed a numeric keyboard for text fields (name, brand), making it impossible to enter non-numeric characters. (Fixes #56)
*   **Critical: Create/Edit Routine Bugs**
    *   Resolved an issue where adding a new exercise to a routine did not visually update the list on the screen until the app was restarted. (Fixes #58)
    *   Fixed a bug where exercises added to a routine were missing their details (name, muscle groups) due to an inconsistent database query.
    *   Addressed a UI state bug where adding, removing, or changing set types in the routine editor would not update the UI in real-time.
*   **Database Stability:**
    *   Prevented crashes when saving custom food items by making the database insertion logic resilient to schema differences between the app model and the asset database.

*   Fixed localization issue in the base foods catalog, ensuring food names are displayed in the correct language.

## Release Notes - 0.4.0-alpha.10+4010

### ✨ New Features & Major Improvements

*   **Enhanced Fluid Tracking:**
    *   Any liquid can now be logged with a name, quantity, sugar, and caffeine content via the new "+" menu.
    *   When logging food items, you can now specify that it is a liquid ("Add to water intake"). The quantity is then correctly added to the daily water goal.
*   **Automatic Caffeine Tracking:**
    *   Daily caffeine intake is now automatically calculated and displayed in the nutrition summary.
    *   Caffeine can be specified in "mg per 100ml" for both custom liquids and food items marked as liquid.
    *   A new "Caffeine" entry has been added to the trackable supplements.
*   **Improved Nutrition Analysis:**
    *   Calculations in the nutrition analysis (`nutrition_screen.dart`) and on the dashboard (`diary_screen.dart`) now correctly include calories, carbs, and sugar from all logged fluids.
*   **Expanded "Add" Menu:**
    *   The central speed-dial menu has been expanded with "Add Liquid" and "Log Supplement" options for faster access.

### 🐛 Bugfixes & Improvements

*   **Data Integrity on Deletion:** Fixed a critical bug where deleting fluid or food entries did not remove associated supplement logs (e.g., for caffeine). The deletion logic has been revised to ensure data consistency.
*   **Database Structure:** The database has been updated to version 19 to enable linking between food, fluid, and supplement entries.
*   **UI Improvements in Diary:** Fluids are now displayed in their own section (`Water & Drinks`) on the diary page for better clarity.
*   **Data Backup Fixes:** The backup model (`HypertrackBackup`) has been updated to correctly handle the new `FluidEntry` data.
