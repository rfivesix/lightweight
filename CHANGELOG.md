### Added
* **App icon:** Now there is an App icon
### Fixed
* **Backup:** tried to fix the backup
### Changed
* **App Name:** Changed the name from "Lightweight" to "Hypertrack".


## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2025-10-19

### Added

*   **New Feature: Onboarding Screen**
    *   Implemented the full, interactive Onboarding process for new users (or when the app is reset).
*   **New Feature: Initial Tab Navigation**
    *   The Main Screen now supports starting on a specific tab, improving navigation flexibility (e.g., deep linking).
*   **Fluid Log Editing**
    *   The "Edit Fluid Entry" dialog now includes fields for the **Name**, **Sugar per 100ml**, and **Caffeine per 100ml**, allowing for precise editing of non-water drinks.

### Fixed

*   **Critical Data Consistency: Fluid/Liquid Food Deletion**
    *   Fixed a critical bug where deleting a **liquid food entry** (e.g., a juice logged via the food tracker) did not correctly remove the linked Fluid Log and Caffeine Log entries, causing orphaned data (Fixes logic in `deleteFluidEntry`).
*   **Modal Display Issue (UX)**
    *   Fixed a bug where the Glass Bottom Menu (and other modals) sometimes failed to display correctly over the main navigation stack.
*   **Live Workout View**
    *   Corrected the padding in the Live Workout screen's exercise list, preventing the final exercise from being obscured by the bottom navigation/content spacer.

### Changed

*   **Major Branding Change: Renamed to "Lightweight"**
    *   The application has been officially renamed from **"Vita" to "Lightweight"** across all screens, assets, bundle identifiers, and localization files.
*   **UX Improvement: Modernized Edit Dialogs**
    *   The "Edit Food Entry" and "Edit Fluid Entry" flows in the Diary screen were upgraded from the old `AlertDialog` to the new **Glass Bottom Menu (Bottom Sheet)**, improving mobile UX.

## [0.4.0-alpha.12] - 2025-10-15

### Added

*   **New Feature: Today's Workout Summary on Diary Screen**
    *   Workout statistics (Duration, Volume, Set Count) for the current day are now displayed directly on the Diary/Nutrition screen (Issue #55).
*   **New Hub UI: Nutrition Hub Overhaul**
    *   The **Nutrition Hub** (`/nutrition-hub` - Issue #53) has been completely redesigned with an improved UI and UX, including new statistical cards and analysis gateways.
*   **Database Asset Versioning**
    *   Implemented a robust versioning system for all internal asset databases (`vita_base_foods.db`, `vita_prep_de.db`, `vita_training.db`). This ensures that core app data is updated when the app version changes, preventing outdated database contents.
*   **Workout History Details**
    *   The Workout History screen now displays the **Total Volume** (in kg) and **Total Sets** for each logged workout, providing more context at a glance.
*   **Automatic Backup Check**
    *   The app now checks for and runs the automated daily backup process upon startup, increasing data security.
*   **New Routine Quick-Create Card**
    *   A new "Create Routine" card has been added to the Workout Hub for quick access.

### Fixed

*   **Critical: Database Name Display**
    *   Fixed a critical bug where localized food names (e.g., German, English) were not correctly retrieved from the product database, leading to the display of wrong or empty names in some parts of the app (Issue #56).
*   **Critical: Backup and Restore Stability**
    *   Fixed multiple critical issues related to the full backup/restore process (Issue #52), ensuring that **Supplements**, **Supplement Logs**, and detailed **Workout Set Logs** are correctly serialized, backed up, and restored.
*   **Workout History Filtering**
    *   Fixed a bug in the workout database helper that caused uncompleted/draft workout logs to be included in the history; only workouts with the status `completed` are now shown.
*   **Exercise Name Localization**
    *   Corrected the logic for displaying exercise names in the Exercise Catalog and Detail screens to correctly prioritize localized names (`name_de`, `name_en`).
*   **Profile Picture Deletion**
    *   Fixed an issue where deleting the profile picture did not work as intended (Issue #31).
*   **Fluid Log Processing**
    *   The calculation for Carbs and Sugar in fluid entries is now correctly scaled by the logged quantity.

### Changed

*   **Reworked Add Menu (FAB)**
    *   The Floating Action Button (FAB) menu on the main screen has been refined for better usability and visual feedback (Issue #50).
*   **Improved Water Section UI/UX**
    *   The Water section in the Diary screen has received general UI/UX enhancements (Issue #54).
*   **Routineless Workout Restoration**
    *   Restoring a workout that was not based on a routine now correctly determines the order of exercises based on the original log order.
*   **Enhanced Swipe-to-Delete Confirmation**
    *   Added explicit confirmation dialogues for the swipe-to-delete actions on Routines, Meals, and Nutrition/Fluid Logs to prevent accidental data loss.
*   **Improved Search Queries**
    *   Product search now searches across `name`, `name_de`, and `name_en` fields, significantly improving discoverability.
*   **UI/UX Refinements**
    *   Numerous minor style adjustments across the app (typography, button padding, list item shadows) for a cleaner, more consistent look.

## Release Notes - 0.4.0-alpha.10+4010

### ‚ú® New Features & Major Improvements

    *   Any liquid can now be logged with a name, quantity, sugar, and caffeine content via the new "+" menu.

*   **Expanded "Add" Menu:**
    *   The central speed-dial menu has been expanded with "Add Liquid" and "Log Supplement" options for faster access.

### üêõ Bugfixes & Improvements

*   **Data Integrity on Deletion:** Fixed a critical bug where deleting fluid or food entries did not remove associated supplement logs (e.g., for caffeine). The deletion logic has been revised to ensure data consistency.
*   **Database Structure:** The database has been updated to version 19 to enable linking between food, fluid, and supplement entries.
*   **UI Improvements in Diary:** Fluids are now displayed in their own section (`Water & Drinks`) on the diary page for better clarity.
