## Key Modules

### 🍎 Nutrition Tracking
Manage daily food and fluid intake with a searchable product database powered by [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/).

- **Food Logging:** Search by name or scan barcodes. Entries are categorized by meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack).
- **Fluid Tracking:** Dedicated logging for water, coffee, and beverages with automatic caffeine and sugar tracking per 100ml.
- **Meal Templates:** Create reusable meals from frequently eaten food combinations.
- **Macro & Micro Targets:** Track daily goals for Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fiber, Sugar, Salt, and Water.
- **Nutrition Analysis:** Time-range based reports (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, all time) with expandable/collapsible summaries.
- **🤖 AI Meal Capture (v0.6):** Log meals instantly via photo, voice, or text description. AI detects individual foods with estimated quantities — review and edit before saving. Supports OpenAI GPT-4o and Google Gemini (BYOK — bring your own key).

### 🏋️ Workout Management
Build routines, track live sessions, and review performance history.

- **Routine Builder:** Compose workouts from an exercise catalog with planned sets, rep targets, and rest times.
- **Live Workout:** Real-time logging with set types (Normal, Warmup, Dropset, Failure), integrated rest timer, and reference to previous performance.
- **Exercise Catalog:** Filterable by category and muscle group. Custom exercises can be created.
- **Workout History:** Browse past sessions with detailed breakdowns of volume, tonnage, and personal records.

### 📐 Body Measurements
Track your body composition and physical dimensions over time.

- **Session-Based Logging:** Record multiple measurements (weight, chest, waist, arms, legs, etc.) in a single session.
- **Trend Charts:** Interactive charts powered by `fl_chart` to visualize progress.

*Data model details → [Data Models: Measurements](data_models_and_storage.md#4-measurements)*

### 💊 Supplement Tracking
Log supplement intake and monitor consistency.

- **Supplement Catalog:** Define your supplement stack with default doses, units, and daily limits.
- **Daily Logging:** Track intake with dose and timestamp. Caffeine supplements are automatically aggregated with fluid entries.

### 🔒 Data Management & Privacy
Full control over your data with comprehensive import/export tools.

- **JSON Backup:** Full application state export with optional AES encryption.
- **CSV Export:** Selective export of nutrition diary, measurements, or workout history.
- **Third-Party Import:** Migration tool for [Hevy](https://hevyapp.com) CSV workout data with exercise name mapping.
- **Auto-Backup:** Configurable automatic backup to a user-selected directory.

## Application Flow

```
AppInitializerScreen
├── ❓ First launch → OnboardingScreen → MainScreen
└── ✅ Returning user → MainScreen
                          ├── Tab 0: DiaryScreen (Nutrition Timeline)
                          ├── Tab 1: WorkoutHubScreen
                          ├── Tab 2: Home (Dashboard)
                          ├── Tab 3: StatisticsHubScreen
                          └── Tab 4: NutritionHubScreen
```

The `MainScreen` uses a `PageView` with a `BottomNavigationBar` to switch between the five core tabs. A persistent floating action button provides quick-add options, and an overlay bar appears during active workout sessions.
