# Shared Analytics Logic & Definitions

This document defines the core business logic and shared rules for the new Statistics & Analytics Tab (Issue #89). It ensures that all charts, PR calculations, and insights remain consistent across the app.

## Versioning Note

The definitions in this document represent the v1 analytics rules for the new Statistics tab. Some heuristics (especially muscle weighting and recovery interpretation) may be refined later, but all implementation in the next version should use these rules consistently unless explicitly changed.

## 1. Set Classifications

### What counts as a "Work Set"?
A set is considered a **Work Set** (also known as a "Hard Set") and included in volume, PR, and muscle frequency calculations *only if* it meets all the following criteria:
*(Note: Field names map exactly to the `SetLog` database model properties: `isCompleted`, `setType`, `weightKg`, `reps`, `distanceKm`, `durationSeconds`, `rir`, `rpe`.)*
- `isCompleted == true` (has actually been performed).
- `setType` is **not** `"warmup"` (must be `"normal"`, `"failure"`, `"dropset"`, etc.).
- `weightKg` is not null and `> 0` (or `distanceKm > 0` for cardio).
- `reps` is not null and `> 0` (or `durationSeconds > 0` for cardio or isometric).

### Handling of Specific Set Types
- **Warm-up Sets:** Ignored for all volume, PR, and muscle group tracking. Only considered for total workout duration and session analysis in the backend.
- **Failure Sets:** Counted as standard work sets. Assumed to have `RIR = 0`. Used to track failure frequency heuristics over time.
- **Dropsets:** Counted as standard work sets. Their volume (weight × reps) is fully added to the total. If grouped with a parent set, they contribute to the parent exercise's total volume.

## 2. Volume Calculations

Volume can be tracked in two primary ways: **Total Tonnage** (Weight × Reps) and **Hard Set Count**. The standard is context-dependent:

- **Exercise Volume (Tonnage):** 
  `Σ (weightKg * reps)` across all **Work Sets** for that specific exercise in a given session.
- **Muscle Group Volume (Hard Sets):** 
  Hypertrophy research favors tracking the *number of hard sets* rather than raw tonnage. 
  Muscle volume = `Σ Work Sets` targeting that muscle.
- **Session Volume (Total Tonnage):** 
  The sum of all Exercise Volumes within a single `WorkoutLog`.

## 3. PR (Personal Record) Logic

PRs are evaluated on two fronts: **Estimated 1RM** and **Repetition Maxes**.

### Estimated 1RM Formula
Calculated using the **Brzycki formula**: `Weight * (36 / (37 - Reps))`
*Constraint:* To ensure data quality, Estimated 1RM is only calculated for sets with **≤ 10 reps**. Sets with > 10 reps skew the math and should not generate new 1RM PRs.

### Rep Ranges for Rep-Max PRs
Instead of tracking a PR for every arbitrary rep count, rep ranges are grouped into "brackets" for trend analysis:
- **1 RM** (True Max)
- **2-3 RM** (Heavy Strength)
- **4-6 RM** (Strength / Hypertrophy)
- **7-10 RM** (Hypertrophy)
- **11-15 RM** (Endurance / Hypertrophy)
- **15+ RM** (Endurance)

The highest weight lifted within a bracket establishes the PR for that bracket.

## 4. Muscle Group Weighting & Frequency

*(Note: These are v1 heuristics for baseline functionality.)*

Exercises often engage multiple muscles. To prevent over-calculating volume, we use a fractional distribution method.

**Volume / Hard Set Distribution:**
- **Primary Muscles:** Receive **100%** of the set's value (1.0).
- **Secondary Muscles:** Receive **50%** of the set's value (0.5).

*Example:* 3 sets of Bench Press (Primary: Chest, Secondary: Triceps, Shoulders).  
*Result:* Chest = 3.0 sets, Triceps = 1.5 sets, Shoulders = 1.5 sets.

**Frequency Counting:**
Muscle frequency evaluates how often a muscle is trained per week. A muscle is counted as "trained" on a given day if the user accumulates at least **1.0 equivalent hard sets** (e.g., 1 primary exercise set or 2 secondary exercise sets) for that muscle on that calendar day.

---

## 5. Smoothing Methods for Trend Charts

Raw fitness data is highly volatile. Trend charts (e.g., Estimated 1RM over time, Bodyweight, Volume per week) will use a **7-Day Rolling Average** or a **14-Day Rolling Average** depending on the selected time window (1 month view vs. 6 month view).

- **< 3 months view:** 7-Day Rolling Average.
- **> 3 months view:** 14-Day Rolling Average.

---

## 6. Recovery Heuristics

*(Note: These are v1 heuristics for baseline functionality.)*

Recovery is calculated as a high-level heuristic based on the time elapsed since a muscle group was last trained with significant volume:

- **< 48 hours:** Categorized as "Recovering" (High Fatigue).
- **48 - 72 hours:** Categorized as "Ready/Recovered" (Moderate Fatigue).
- **> 72 hours:** Categorized as "Fresh" (Low Fatigue).

*Modifiers:* If average `RIR` for the session was `0` (high exhaustion) or average `RPE` was `≥ 9`, recovery thresholds are extended by +24 hours.

## 7. Data Quality & Insight Suppression

To prevent the analytics tab from showing flawed or meaningless charts (e.g., a "trend" based on only two workouts), dynamic insights apply a suppression rule:

- **Minimum Data Requirement:** Trend lines and PR extrapolations for a specific exercise or muscle group will **only** render if there are at least **3 distinct data points** spread across **a minimum of 14 days**.
- If data quality is too low, the UI will display a placeholder state: *"Keep tracking to unlock insights."*
