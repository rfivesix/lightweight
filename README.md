# Hypertrack

**The modern, privacy-first fitness & nutrition tracker.**

Hypertrack (formerly *Hypertrack*) is an open-source, offline-first application built with Flutter. It aims to replace fragmented fitness tools by combining advanced workout logging, nutrition tracking, and body metrics into a single, cohesive ecosystem—without compromising your data privacy.

## ⚠️ **Important Disclaimer: Active Beta**

**Please read before using:**

Hypertrack has completed its **v0.5 Architecture Update**. The database has been entirely rewritten using **Drift** (SQLite ORM) and all identifiers have been migrated to **UUIDs (v4)**. The core data foundation is now stable and cloud-ready.

* **Stable Foundation:** The database structure is solidified and no further breaking schema changes are expected.
* **Active Beta:** The app is under active development—new features and refinements are being added regularly. Minor bugs may still occur.
* **Recommendation:** We still recommend using the built-in **Backup (JSON)** feature regularly, as best practice for any app in active development.
